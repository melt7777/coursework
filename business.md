# Giving and Receiving Feedback

## Alignment

We articulate vision and priorities for the company to our people.

### Coaching 
- the vehicle for aligning the organization 
- identify weaknesses and specify 1-3 areas of improvement 
- a coach must actually observe you, directly or indirectly
- Everyone needs a coach. Your responsibility to find one.

### Mentoring 
- outside advice dependent on quality / blind spots of your story telling to them. 
- much less effective.

### Review 
- is a verdict - coaching happens during the year. 
- a surprise here will lose trust. coach in advance, to allow them a chance to improve.

## Law of Likability

Curiosity - creates connections
Ask, elaborate, empower, collaborate

1. Ask
- start with an open ended question: "what do you think ____"
- Listen to get understanding, concern, interpretation, of situation

2. Elaborate 
- add information, bring them some information back 
- share your perspective
- elevate the other person 

Pause to think about root causes 

3. Empower
- flex to the employee - get to the point if they are direct.
- get them to call the next steps as they see it

4. Collaborate
- build off their ideas
- i love that! in addition, maybe....
- Law of similarity - share a similar experience to build trust - create teachable moment
- openness fosters teamwork
