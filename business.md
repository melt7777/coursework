## Alignment

We articulate vision and priorities for the company to our people.

### Coaching 
- the vehicle for aligning the organization 
- identify weaknesses and specify 1-3 areas of improvement 
- a coach must actually observe you, directly or indirectly
- Everyone needs a coach. Your responsibility to find one.

### Mentoring 
- outside advice dependent on quality / blind spots of your story telling to them. 
- much less effective.

### Review 
- is a verdict - coaching happens during the year. 
- a surprise here will lose trust. coach in advance, to allow them a chance to improve.
